Make sure to download the word list text file.
You can also just make your own word list with words separated by spaces, and change the code to your file name, but given the laziness of humanity these days, I dont expect anyone to do this.
Guess letters and try not to get hung.
You can also guess an entire word but if you guess wrong, then you lose.
Maybe I'll eventually add visuals.
